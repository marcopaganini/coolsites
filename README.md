# Cool Sites üï∂

This is a list of cool, awesome, and useful websites that a lot of people
don't know. I've decided to save these here so others can benefit (and I can
find them again).

There's no hard criteria for inclusion, but keep a few basics in mind:

‚úîÔ∏è  The site should be generally useful and/or cool.</br>
‚úîÔ∏è  The site should offer a useful free tier.</br>
‚ùå No malware or scams of any kind.</br>
‚ùå No paywalls.</br>
‚ö†Ô∏è  We _prefer_ sites that don't require registration.

If you have a new site to contribute, or found a broken/invalid site, feel free to
send a PR or open an issue.

Make sure to ‚≠ê [star the repo on github](https://github.com/marcopaganini/coolsites) if you like the content.
